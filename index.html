                <p>Oscar Medina began learning how to play guitar at the age of 10 from his father and then learned bass guitar at age 11 where he was in his first garage band with his school friends. He then joined the middle school band in eighth grade and picked the french horn. After earning his high school diploma, he began working on his Bachelor of Music at Texas A&M University â€“ Kingsville. While a horn and bass music student, he performed with the TAMUK Horn Choir, Q1 Horn Quartet, Jazz Band and Jazz Combos in many locations including Texas, Alabama, Illinois, Colorado and abroad in Germany and at the International Horn Symposium in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. He was also a string bassist in 2006 with the TAMUK Wind Symphony at the Texas Music Educators Association in San Antonio, TX. As an educator, his students were regular members of the TMEA Region XV Band/Orchestra, TMEA XV Jazz Bands, and were superior performers at UIL State Solo & Ensemble and UIL Concert & Sight-Reding contests. Outside of work, Oscar performed regularly with the McAllen Wind Ensemble and the RGV Swing Street Big Band. </p>
